# Input function
When you **run** this piece of code:

print("Hello " + input("Enter your name: "))

It ask your name before displaying it:
```
Enter your name: username
Hello username
```
The **input** function gets executed, then return the entered value to the **print** function before displaying the final string

The Thonny Python IDE can be a great tool to visualize in which order the functions are getting called in this line of code.
